Installation
=================================

We recommend installing ``pymdp`` using the package installer pip_, which will install the package locally as well as its dependencies.
This can also be done in a virtual environment (e.g. one created using ``venv`` or ``conda``). 

When pip installing ``pymdp``, use the full package name: ``inferactively-pymdp``:

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install inferactively-pymdp
   
.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/
